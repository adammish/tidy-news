Features include:

* Select from over 100 news sources
* Limit of 10 stories at a time per news source and no endless scroll
* Add/remove news sources from your Favorites
* Toggle whether you want to see images for stories or not
* Respects your system's light/dark mode settings (view images above)
* Current news source, Favorites, and image preference are saved in the browser's local storage so you can pick up where you left off
* Completely responsive, and can be made a progressive web app if desired

_Note: Due to recent changes in the [News API](https://newsapi.org/)'s free tier, this app can not run on a custom domain without a paid account. However, this app can still be used to check the news for free on_ `localhost`.

## To use locally

1. Clone repo, and `cd tidy-news`
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `cp .env.example .env`
4. Go to https://newsapi.org/register and sign up for a free api key
5. Add your api key to your new `.env` file
6. Run `npm start` or `yarn start`
7. Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see __tidy news__!

When youâ€™re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with `npm run build`.

## To use in production

If you have a paid [News API](https://newsapi.org/) account and want to deploy __tidy news__ to a domain, running `npm run build` or `yarn build` will build the app for production to the `build` folder.

This correctly bundles __tidy news__ in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
